            — If there isn't a current update about your idols (especially those you handle), but you still want to share content related to your idol, please post it in the idol's channel rather than the main channel.<br>

            — Please do not post videos/pictures that sexualize the idols or include excessively provocative photos of them. I want to emphasize that these types of posts should not be shared.<br> </p></h2></body>
