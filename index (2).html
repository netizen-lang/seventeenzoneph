                <p>Seventeen (Korean: 세븐틴; RR: Sebeuntin; stylized in all caps or as SVT) is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has won a large audience since its debut and has grown into an internationally recognized K-pop group with signature music and performances.<br>

                    The group debuted on May 26, 2015, with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat, which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's "10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015" list. Seventeen has released four studio albums, twelve EPs, and three reissues.<br>
                    
                    Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members involved in songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music and performances. They perform as one group and are divided into three units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. They have been labeled "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-Pop", and "K-Pop Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.[2][3][4][5]<br><br>
                    
                    Name
                    The name Seventeen is derived from the expression "13 members + 3 teams + 1 group", representing how the 13 members are divided into three different teams and come together to form one cohesive group.[6][7] The name originally referred to how 17 members (with the other 4 former pre-debut trainees — Jang Do-yoon, Samuel Kim, Shin Dong-jin, and Yao Mingming) — planned to debut.[8]<br>
                    
                    The official name of Seventeen's fan club is "Carat" (Korean: 캐럿), as announced at a concert on February 14, 2016.[9] Named after the measurement unit for diamonds, it is a reference to their debut EP 17 Carat and its opening song "Shining Diamond".[10][11] Seventeen have a global fan club hosted via Weverse[12] and a Japan-specific fan club.[13]<br><br>

                    On September 10, 2015, Seventeen released their second EP Boys Be, which later became the highest-selling rookie album of the year.[23] The EP's success earned the group awards at the Golden Disk Awards, Seoul Music Awards, and Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards.[24] Seventeen became the only K-pop group on Billboard's "21 Under 21 2015: Music's Hottest Young Stars" list.[25][26] Seventeen held a four-show concert series in Seoul titled 2015 Like Seventeen – Boys Wish from December 24 to 26 as a year-end celebration.[27] After the concerts' success, Seventeen held two more in the following February in 2016, the Like Seventeen – Boys Wish Encore Concert.[28]<br>

In addition to success on domestic charts, the album charted on the Oricon Weekly Pop Album Chart in Japan.[29][30] Seventeen received their first win on a domestic music show with the album's lead single "Pretty U".[31] Love & Letter was later re-released on July 4 with lead single "Very Nice".[32][33] Promotions were immediately followed by Seventeen's 1st Asia Tour 2016 Shining Diamonds, which included venues in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, and China.[34][35] On December 5, the group released their third EP, Going Seventeen with lead single "Boom Boom" (붐붐).[36][37]
