        <p>        Dear admins, I kindly request that you refrain from discussing topics related to Palestine or genocide. These issues are sensitive and have the potential to cause conflict, especially with shallow-minded individuals. If you come across someone discussing these topics in the channel or group chat, please ask them to stop and kindly explain why. Thank you for your understanding.
        </p>
        <p>During a conversation, I encountered someone who was not opposed to boycotting certain brands due to their involvement in genocide. Despite my attempts to explain why boycotting may be an effective solution, they continued to argue their point. As a result, we collectively decided to refrain from discussing this topic in our group channels and chats. I hope everyone understands and respects this decision.</p>
